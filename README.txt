Why we deserve 100/100: Our project meets all of the desired criteria, giving the player a couple twists throughout the game. This includes speeding up at certain points
                        throughout the game as well as a feature that doesn't allow the player to turn back right next to the snakes tail without possibly dying if they
                        go too quickly. We have an extensive network of javascript functions that work in tandem to power our game.

CSS3 features: Title Transitions, Background, Flexbox, Bootstrap

JS Libraries: p5, jQuery

Nifty Features that were hard: Ensuring the snake had a properly moving tail, adding units to the snake, ensuring good collision detection
